## Project Proposal ##
* Individual project Recipe Maker
* Repo contributor: Yuan

* Proposal
* Unique product design:
 1.	Searching specific food by using a food type, and food origin and ingredients and key word.
2.	Created Ingredients list for user to look at how many types of ingredients uses.
3.	Created category list for user to look at what kind of food included.
4.	Created Country list for user to look at where is the recipe comes from.
5.	Adding and modify recipe recipes easily in system. 
6.	“Adding button” can lead you to create and save your own recipes.
7.	“Help button” is for user guide. Like recipe use information, and App description.

* Challenge:
1.	Time limits
2.	Thinking a lot of features, but need give some time for testing
3.	Risks thinking. Analyze which category has and must to finished before product delivery
4.	Product requirement. Talked with customer (instructor Michal) about the MVP product and additional design.
